<h1 align="center">Welcome to Bakkatown Belize ðŸ‘‹</h1>

## What project is it?

> This is the Capstone team project I had in the last semester of college(SAIT), and I was one of six team members. I was in charge of the design and function development of front-end for users. In this repository, only the code I wrote exists due to security reasons.

## What I worked on

- Booking Page (Availability, Rental, Guest Details and Summary)
- Account Page (Login, Signup, Forgot password, Reservation List, Review and Logout)
- Navbar
- Sidebar
- Landing Page
- Overview Page
- Map Page
- Gallery Page
- Rates Page
- Availability Page
- Reviews Page
- Contact Page

## What is the purpose of the project?

> BakkaTown Hostel is a young accommodation business located in San Pedro. The current system has been not created a lot of interest for the business and created booking errors in the past. The new web app will have a centralized booking management system plus a more user-friendly UI for their clients. This system document will specify the newly designed booking system with details such as the business objectives, user requirements, system functionality, and booking solution.
